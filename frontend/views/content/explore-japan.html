        <h4>The land of the rising sun</h4>
        <p>
            Japan is truly timeless, a place where ancient traditions are fused with modern life as if it were the most natural thing in the world. The "Land of the Rising Sun" is where the past meets the future. Japanese culture stretches back millennia, yet has also been quick to adopt and created the latest modern fashions and trends. Japan has often been seen in the West as a land combining tradition and modernity, and many traditional structures and practices are preserved, but modern structures and practices definitely dominate your experience in Japan. Japan was the first Asian country to independently modernize, and the country continues to embrace new technologies and aesthetics, but unlike in many countries, Japan does not feel a particular need to attack or remove older technologies, structures, or practices.
